            Welcome to the page of ideas I made in the quarantine since... yesterday. This isn't an actual part of the site, it's just easiset to have my backups here.

            <!--STRANGER song Paragraph, explaining its origins and displaying an audio element to play the song itself-->
            
            Once upon NZ’s third lockdown, I decided to put my time towards something with a little more soul than another thirty hours on some game or the homework I was actually assigned: a melody, entirely based off of a smooth, upright bass riff that plays throughout the entire piece I had come up with as an alternative take on another song’s main riff. ‘Stranger’ is the most Jazz-themed song out of my entire portfolio, even apparently particularly reminiscent to Estonian jazz. <br> Nonetheless, It’s one of the more inspiring tunes in my playlist, so enjoy seeing where it takes you.<br>
